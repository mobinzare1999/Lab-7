Evaluation of sorting algorithms
Consider the following sorting algorithms to sort vectors of integers in ascending order:
 Selection Sort
 Insertion Sort
Write a C program that acquires numerical sequences from a file (sort.txt) and calls all the above-mentioned sorting algorithms on each sequence, printing the following output on the screen:
 the number of swaps
 the number of iterations of the outer loop
 per each iteration of the outer loop, the number of iterations of the inner loop
The file sort.txt has the following format:
 the first line reports the number S of numerical sequences that will follow
 in the following S lines, one per line:
<length> <sequence>
where <length> is a positive integer (at most 100) representing the length of the sequence reported in the current
